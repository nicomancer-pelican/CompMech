# CompMech
Coursework for the Computational Mechanics module at Imperial College London (2020/2021).

Tasks:
- to write a finite-element solver that computes the linear static equilibrium of a clamped-clamped beam under constant distributed forces
- to write a nonlinear finite-element solver that computes the geometrically-nonlinear static equilibirum for the same beam under the assumption of negligible horizontal displacements.
